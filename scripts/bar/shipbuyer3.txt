@1 // What ship did they get?
ego:What ship did they get?
other:A  Churchill, it is massive.
other:She's gonna move into commodity trading.
ego:I guess that was the idea of getting that ship.
other:Yeah right. 
other:You should have seen it inside.
other:We had to use bikes to get around.
ego:I bet you could have played football in the cargo bay.
other:Ha, you could have almost had orbital races!
ego:Ha, I'm gonna check the consoles.
other:Safe flying.
ego:Yeah.

@2 // How did they make the creds?
ego:How did they make the creds?
other:She's an expert at doing salvage.
other:She's found loads of Silver and gold.
other:I don't understand why the containers are just left there anyway.
ego:Err, they are destroyed ships.
ego:It's not like they had much time to evacuate.
other:Yes, I know, but sometimes it's like they have been put there after.
ego:Well a lot of them have been.
other:Oh?
ego:Well a lot of them are pirate stashes. 
other:Really. She didn't tell me that.
other:Isn't that dangerous then? Taking crims stuff?
ego:They know the risk of putting it there.
other:And once they leave it, it's fair legal salvage.
ego:You got it. I'm gonna check the consoles.
other:Safe flying.
ego:Safe flying.
