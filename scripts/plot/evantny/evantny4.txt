@S 
other:well done, we will study the photograph.
ego:Thanks, now about that clue.
other:Yeah, it's quite simple, the clue is...
other:Wha.. shit!
ego:That's an odd clue.
other:No, that's not the clue.
other:It's the target, Jek Kek, the guy you photographed.
ego:He's the clue?
other:No. But he is moving. Quickly.
other:It seems he might be suspecting something.
other:You didn't do anything to tip him off, did you?

ego:No.
other:Well, he is moving nonetheless.
other:We're tracking him right now, but he's quick.
other:You're going to have to follow him, and find out what he's doing.

ego:Hey, you're pushing it pal.
ego:The deal was one photograph, and you give me the clue.
other:Yeah, it was.
other:And now I'm altering the terms of the deal.
other:You better hope I don't alter them any further.
ego:You trying to be a tough guy?
ego:What's holding me from smacking this clue out of you right here?
other:I have a neuro-implant. It can erase memories.
other:The Taoists inserted it, in case I was caught.
other:That way, even under torture, the secret location of Walker base is never revealed.
other:It's programmed to erase the clue if anyone harms me.
ego:Bullocks.
other:Believe it or not, can you take the risk?
other:You need to find Walker Base don't you?
ego:Fine. You win.
other:Great. Then you'll follow the target?
ego:Where is he heading?
other:We tracked him to a planet in the Waiool system.
other:I've marked it in your contacts list.
other:He seems to have landed there.
other:You'll have to go down to the surface.
other:Our hangar crew is attaching a landing pod to your ship as we speak.
other:It's equipped with a scrambling device.
other:If it works, the defence systems shouldn't shoot you.
ego:"If it works"?
other:Well, we haven't ever tested it before.
other:But our scientists are fairly certain it will work.
other:They tell me it's up to 98 percent reliable.
ego:"up to"?
other:Trust me, it'll work.
other:Just get close to the planet, and launch the pod.
ego:Fine.
other:Good luck.
