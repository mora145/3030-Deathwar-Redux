@1
ego:I'm having trouble killing pirates.
other:You shouldn't be. They're all looking for you.
ego:Tell me about it.
other:Make sure you get all the necessary upgrades from here before you start off.
ego:like what?
other:Well, there's the 'whos targeting me' upgrade.
other:you definitely need a combat scanner.
other:Perhaps an ECM and an afterburner.
ego:Ok, thanks for your help.
other:No problem. Good luck.
other:Don't forget to see j'mes learner when you have more than 10 kills.

@2
ego:Can't you help me with the password?
other:No, I'm afraid I can't. I don't know it.
other:But j'mes learner does. See him - after you've killed 50 pirates.
other:And he'll help you out.
ego:ok, thanks.
