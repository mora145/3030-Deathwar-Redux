ego:You wanted to see me?
other:Yeah, I heard you have all the clues. 
other:I don't know how you use them.
other:But i guess they fit together somehow.
other:It's so that no individual can have the location beaten out of them.
ego:I get it. 
other:I do know that if you find the base, you will need a password when you dock.
ego:Why is that?
other:In case a trader accidentally finds walker base, or worse, an enemy agent.
other:We couldn't have them just docking and walking around.

@1 // Well, what's the password?
ego:Well, what's the password?
other:I don't know it. 
ego:Who does?
other:Well, there was a fellow in daphice who knew, waylen dor.
other:But you know what happened there. There is another but I'm not sure of his location.
other:All I know is the system he resides in.
other:Kp-FQ1. It's a pirate system with two pirates stations and two council stations.
ego:So you don't know which station he's at?
other:No
ego:How many stations are there in kp-fq1?
other:Four, but you'll be able to dock at two of them.
other:If you hadn't noticed you have one hell of a criminal record.
ego:Great. What's his name?
other:J'mes Learner.
ego:Names are never simple around here are they.
other:I quite agree. 
other:One other thing, he won't talk to you unless you're experienced enough.
other:He's very strange like that. He's one of the elders. 
other:I think having 10 kills should be enough to make him take you seriously.
ego:How do I get 10 kills?
other:If you haven't got them already then you must kill 10 or more pirates.
other:According to the council record keeping system a pirate it counts as +1 kill.
other:Killing a police officer or cargo ship counts as -2 kills.
other:You can handle it.
other:When you find walker base, dock and talk to 433-2c.
other:A good friend of mine. He will fill you in.
other:Be careful and stock up on fuel here.
other:Better still, buy a fuel scoop. 
other:You won't be able to dock at council stations at all.
ego:Yeah, it was hard enough getting here.
other:I bet. Stay safe.
