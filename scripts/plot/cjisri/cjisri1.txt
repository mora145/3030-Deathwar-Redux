ego:What?!
other:Yes, the person you know as Morgan Yu is not a friend of ours at all.
other:He is an agent of F'Zuh, the leader of the cleaners as you know them.
other:He is the centre of a dastardly plot to have you killed.
ego:Me? Why?

@7 // What prophecy is this?
ego:What prophecy is this?
other:It is written that the person with the name of a bird will save us.
ego:Ahhh, and because of my surname you think it's me.
other:Not me, but someone does, and it must have stalled F'Zuh.
other:F'Zuh must think killing you would put the old plan back into action.
ego:What old plan?
other:300 years ago we split off from the council...
other:...when we had realised the destruction of the galaxy was wrong.
ego:You only realised that 300 years ago?
other:There were mitigating circumstances I won't go into now...
other:...but we firmly believe we need the life in this galaxy...
other:...to continue and fulfill our ultimate destiny; to become one being.
other:Well, you can take it or leave it. I personally don't believe any of it.
ego:That makes no sense, but keep going.
other:So, after thousands of years of destroying life...
other:...we split and started a group you know as the taoists.
ego:Yes, I know them.
other:The only reason the council do not continue the attacks...
other:...is because council members firmly believe in this prophecy. 
other:So much so that your possible demise...
other:...is enough for them to contemplate continuing their plan for galactic control.
ego:So you're saying it's important for me to stay alive.
ego:For more reasons than the obvious.
other:Exactly.
ego:I agree.
other:To that end, we have made some plans for you.
other:We'll change your ship, your reg code and give you some money.
other:It's important for you to be safe...
other:...so we'll divulge the location of an important station.
other:Walker base is the taoist stronghold. 
other:Unfortunately even I don't know where it is currently.
other:The fewer people know, the safer it is.

@9 // So how do I find it?
ego:So how do I find it?
other:There are four clues each initiate gets. 
other:If he is worthy he will find walker base.
other:If not.. well, it was not meant to be.

@11 // What are these clues then?
ego:What are these clues then?
other:They are obtained by visiting four people and asking them.
other:Some might ask you to complete a task.
other:When you have fulfilled their request they will give you the clue.
other:When you have all four clues you will be able to find walker base.
other:That is all I can say at this time.
other:Because of compartmentalisation...
other:...I do not have either the money or contacts for you.
other:You must travel to beexen. there you'll meet a friend of ours called raal.
other:Seek her out. To aid you, I have the location of a wormhole.
other:It will greatly speed up your travel time.
other:Go to the second moon of the planet in the aenso system. 
other:There you'll find a wormhole.
other:Rumour is another one opened up recently too!
ego:That's what I'm talkin about!
ego:Useful information. I'll note it in my log.
other:If you find the right one will bring you to beexen within seconds.
ego:Second moon of the planet in aenso, got it. 
other:Right. If you find it. Get a buoy and mark its location.
other:When you get to the other side, remember that location too.
other:They can be tough to locate, and don't appear on the charts.
