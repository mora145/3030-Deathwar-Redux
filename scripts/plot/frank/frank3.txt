ego:Ok, I'll do it. When and where?
other:Ok, you gotta find Jimmy Chou.
other:The only problem is I'm not sure where he is. He's in this system,
other:I'm sure of that. I'm just not sure which station.
other:Board whichever station you think he's on, if he's there, talk to him.
other:Hell he could even be on this station. I don't know.
ego:I'm just interested in how much you're going to pay me.
other:Luckily for you, kid, Chou will offer you some jobs.
ego:You better feel lucky, frank.
other:Why?
ego:Lucky I don't punch you in the face.
