other:That was a battle well fought.
other:But the war is not yet won.
ego:It's not?
ego:But we blew up their command ship.
other:The command ship, yes.
other:But the cleaner commander, F'zuh still lives.
ego:He's just one guy. Is that really that bad?
other:He is in hiding, and preparing to release all of the nanos...
other:thus killing everyone on every station and every planet.
ego:Ok, that's bad.
other:Luckily we intercepted the command ship's final message.
other:It was a launch code...
other:and is the last puzzle piece needed to launch the nanos.
other:The target of the message was somewhere in the badlands.
other:You'll need to go there and find him.
other:And then end his plans, by any means necessary.
ego:What? Me again?
other:Yes, you're our most trusted and reliable pilot.
other:Also, you're the only one with a gun.
other:It sort of limits our options.
ego:Great.
other:He isn't hiding on the station.
other:We have spies there, and would know of it.
other:He must be somewhere else in the system.
other:You'll find him I'm sure.
other:We're all trusting in you.
other:Not that we have another option.
