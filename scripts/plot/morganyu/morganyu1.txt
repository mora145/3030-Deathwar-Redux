@1 // of course
ego:Of course.
ego:which station?
other:Clearly you can't know it very well...
other:...there is only one station; Ssinil Station 1.
ego:Yes, that was a joke. It's a mining outpost.
other:So will you do it?
ego:How much is the pay?
other:It's a mission of import. I'm afraid i can't give you much, $20,000?
ego:That's a pathetic rate of pay for a faulty droid.
other:Too much money changing hands would draw unwanted attention.

ego:Thanks.
other:The actual destination is the Ssinil Station.
other:So, do you want this mission? It's very simple.
ego:How much does it pay?
other:Only $20,000 I'm afraid. We don't want to draw attention to ourselves.

ego:Ok, I'll get it done.
other:Excellent. I've given the artefact to my associate.
other:He will place the package in your hold shortly.
other:One more thing, it's urgent you get it there as quickly as possible.
other:it's a long journey. You can use a shortcut through the nebula.
other:I've added the nebula gap in your map. 
other:Just view the nebula read-out to see it.
