@1 // Where do you want to go next?
ego:Where do you want to go next?
other:Hmmm.
other:We could check if any jobs go up to andinti.
other:That would be a safe option.
other:Or If you want some flying time...
other:I hear there are moneyball races going on down at Tibefa.
ego:Tibefa? That's due south past the nebula.
other:Yeah. It's a fair distance.
other:And we'd need a good afterburner to compete.
other:It's easy, and the prizes get quite high!
ego:It's easy because people only watch for the fights.
other:That's true, but I do like a bit of moneyball.

other:It's worth it. They are funky.
other:If you leave the nebula map overlay up...
other:...I can map the nebula edges to improve our travel map.
ego:Not sure about that one. Anything else?
other:I always wanted to see the Giant carved-head asteroid station.
ego:GHA Station? That's light years away, and a Pirate station!
other:Yeah, it's north-east from here across Lowell's Divide.
other:System KP-FQI.
other:I know it's far, but we could do jobs on the way.
other:You asked what I wanted. I've never seen it.
other:It would be an achievement for me.
