@1 // About my ship.
ego:About my ship.
other:Yes. It's registered as stolen from Zog Dongo.
other:We have recorded that you bought it from a mechanic called Frank Zoed.
other:But we'll still have to impound it.
ego:Who would have stolen the ship in the first place?
other:Reports are there is a booty filled derelict ship in the area.
other:So probably a gang trying to minimise the salvage competition.
other:By causing crews like yours to lose their ship.
other:Don't go trying to get revenge now.
