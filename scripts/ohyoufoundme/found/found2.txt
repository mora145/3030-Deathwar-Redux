@1
ego:Seems someone is looking for you.
other:Oh yeah? Who?
ego:Can't really say. Confidentiality and all that.
other:Well, maybe I don't want to be found.
ego:Say what?
other:How much is this mystery person offering you?
ego:I can't say. Why?
other:I dunno, just curious I suppose. So what now?
ego:Nothing. I just go back and tell them you're here.
other:Huh. Well, hope it's someone I want to find me.
other:See you around.
