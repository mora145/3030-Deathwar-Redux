dialogue
{
ktafly:It appears falcon is progressing well.
ktafly:I may have started to believe this wild legend.
cjisri:It's that hat. It's a good one.
cjisri:Why can't we just tell him the location of the base?
ktafly:That rule on slow disclosure has saved us many times.
Rich:Like when they sent those fake droids.
cjisri:Oh Yeah. With those pestilent organic endoskeletons.
ktafly:Don't remind me.
ktafly:That episode cost me my best rug.
cjisri:Sorry about that... the flamethrower had no power control.
ktafly:Hmmm.
cjisri:Anyway...
cjisri:If he does find the base then it proves he's a good asset.
cjisri:An asset that will lead to the destruction of the council.
ktafly:Perhaps yes, perhaps no. 
cjisri:Perhaps yes, Fly man.
