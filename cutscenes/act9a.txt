boss:They are as defenceless as us!
falcon:That's a good thing?
boss:We've detected their armada coming towards us.
boss:Probably to destroy us before we release the code. but it's too late.
vas:A quick attack now will catch them unaware. 
boss:Head out with the rest of the fleet to destroy them.
helper:Destroy the cleaner mothership at all costs.
helper:All orders come from that ship.
ktafly:Our drunken informant is correct, Mr Falcon.
ktafly:If we Knock out the mothership...
ktafly:...No more council, no more world destroying nano tech.
falcon:What are our chances then, Mr Robot.
boss:I calculate we have a 70% percent probability... of failure.
Kent:Wrong.
boss:We launch Immediately. I'm boarding my ship right now.
boss:They'll be splitting in any minute now.
boss:You still up for it?
vas:If you need a engineer, I can jump in with you.
Kent:Great! Just like old times.
