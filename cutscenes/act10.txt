dialogue
{
ktafly:We're attempting to cull the bad side of the council.
ktafly:People still think the taoists are bad people after all the propaganda.
ktafly:We will probably disband.
ktafly:We've cleared your criminal record by the way.
falcon:Sound.
ktafly:Once the nano threat has been explained the council will re-allow access to the planets.
ktafly:More will be made habitable again. We can start a-fresh.
boss:We owe you a great deal of gratitude. 
boss:As a small token we have credited your account with a substantial amount of money.
falcon:Visiting a planet with life on it is reward enough. It's amazing.
ktafly:There is one thing though, you cannot tell people of this yet.
Falcon:Right, I can see why.
ktafly:They must learn to understand the council was being manipulated.
ktafly:If they are disillusioned now, the galactic council structure will break down.
ktafly:Then there could be a deathwar.
boss:K'ta is always looking for problems.
ktafly:You are welcome to become one of the first settlers if you are tired of space life.
boss:Ever considered managing a planetoid global re-construction program.
Falcon:Yes.
Falcon:But I expect i'll keep trading a while.
ktafly:Well then, you will not hear from us again for some time. We have a lot to do.
boss:Live long and prosper, Falcon.
ktafly:One thing, why did you ever agree to keep helping us?
Falcon:Honestly..
Falcon:I have absolutely no idea.
