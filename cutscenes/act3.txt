helper2:sir, I have a report from one of my sources...
helper2:...that k'ta fly has been receiving help from a trader.
bossOnbike:His name?
helper2:john falcon.
bossOnbike:what?
helper2:I didn't believe it myself.
helper:A Falcon is a bird, right?
bossOnbike:We won't see the end of this prophecy. 
bossOnbike:they must of heard of this guy.
helper:Because a Falcon is a bird, right?
helper2:The elders on the council still love the legends.
bossOnbike:Yes they do.
helper2:it's the only reason they aren't continuing the cleaner attack plans.
helper:I'm going to assume a Falcon is a bird.
bossOnbike:then perhaps this offers us an opportunity.
helper2:how so?
bossOnbike:if the council believes this john falcon is a legendary whatever... 
bossOnbike:...then they will be pleased to hear of his death.
helper:Like poor Jeff Eagle.
bossOnbike:yes, it worked last time.
helper2:but he's just a human, why think he's the one told of in legend?
bossOnbike:Stop with the incessant bloody questions.
bossOnbike:Always questions!
helper2:you have a plan?
bossOnbike:I surely do. Get my ship ready.
helper:Aye, sir.
