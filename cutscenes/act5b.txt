dialogue
{
bosscape:Why can't we find him?
helper2:Sir, we have been searching but he seems to have disappeared.
bosscape:He can't have just disappeared.
badcop:I was not given his description.
helper2:He's not hard to spot. Always wearing a jacket and brown hat.
badcop:Hey! I think I saw a guy like that on Tia Station!
bosscape:Great. He was probably finding you! 
bosscape:Lets turn up the pressure.
bosscape:Add more incentive for bounty hunters and police to find him.
badcop:No problem. I'll make sure there is a large bounty on his head. 
bosscape:Give him a criminal record that would make "Ghh the destroyer" look like a petty thief.
badcop:It will be done.
