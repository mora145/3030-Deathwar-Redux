helper:No reports of Falcon Sir.
bosscape:Ah, these council police are worthless.
helper:Our probe network could find him.
bosscape:True, I'll try and get clearance to use them.
bosscape:He must have dropped off the grid.
helper:Helped by the traitors?
bosscape:Must have been. See if you can find him.
helper:Yes Sir.
bosscape:I will continue putting pressure on our elders to rebuild our stealth fleet.
bosscape:And once I have tracked down these traitors I will destroy them myself.
