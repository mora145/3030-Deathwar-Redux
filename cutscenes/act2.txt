dialogue
{
helper2:We should finish off these last species and begin terraforming.
helper2:The nanobots have worked perfectly so far. Why the delay? 
bosscape:I'll tell you why.
bosscape:Because now some of us are helping these scum.
helper:Nobody seriously believes the stories do they?
bosscape:If anything matches a detail in their ambiguous legends...
bosscape:...they want to pause the plan.
helper2:And which detail is it this time?
bosscape:"Then the birdperson appeared and caused much Howling!"
helper2:Not that one again. Who was it last time?
helper:Oh yeah, I remember that! Jeff Eagle wasn't it.
bosscape:It's quite preposterous.
helper:I like it.
badcop:Me too.
bosscape:You two, and some of the elders, have brain fade.
bosscape:This is the only thing stopping us clean up space.
bosscape:These beings are disgusting. 
bosscape:They're making my life like a urinal full of spunk.
helper:Ewww. Sir, Please.
helper2:So we just have to wait?
bosscape:I want to release a new wave of nanos right now!
bosscape:But the council is withholding access.
bosscape:We need to remove their fear of this legend.
helper2:Then what are we to do?
bosscape:Keep a lookout for another chump with a bird name.
