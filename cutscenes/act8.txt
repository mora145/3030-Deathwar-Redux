dialogue
{
bossa8:I need you to search asteroid fields in two systems for a cargo container. 
bossa8:We have reason to think it holds an enemy cloaking and shield code module.
bossa8:If so we can un-mask the secret fleet and provide evidence to the public of their plot.
bossa8:At the same time the code should disable the shields of their entire fleet.
bossa8:Then we'll settle this with a regular old space battle. Classic.
