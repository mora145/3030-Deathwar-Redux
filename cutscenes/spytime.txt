helper:A deal is a deal, Gebbo.
badcop:Yeah, give us your nanobots.
seller:For this I'll give you Blue Mambas. The best!
badcop:Noice! Blue Mambas eat through stations in seconds.
badcop:Boss will be well pleased.
seller:I can't believe you found her for me!
badcop:Our whole fleet was sent to scan for it.
helper:We spared no expense for you, Mr Gebbo.
seller:The mummified remains of the Last Queen of Bop!
helper:Your suspicion was correct, Mr Gebbo.
seller:Hidden in the Badlands nebula after the battle of Jowe!
seller:I knew it!
seller:Come with me and I'll give you one nanobot.
seller:It can replicate itself into as many as you plan to use.
seller:It will eat targeted proteins and polymers and spread like the wind.
helper:The lesser species are about to suffer a rapid decline in population.
helper:Muhaha.
badcop:Let's go already.
badcop:It smells like unwashed human in these caves.
helper:Lead the way, Mr Gebbo.
