dialogue
{
helper2:Sir, reports coming in show our enemy have been searching asteroid fields.
bosscape:And?
helper2:Most likely for our ship components.
bosscape:Like what?
helper2:If they recover one of our shield code module's they could..
bosscape:Decrypt our shield codes and disrupt our shields!
bosscape:Inconceivable!
bosscape:If they have the codes, they might stand a chance..
helper2:They are en route to our fleet right now.
bosscape:Ha, even without our shielding, we will crush them!
bosscape:Set course!
