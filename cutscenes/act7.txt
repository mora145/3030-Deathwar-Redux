dialogue
{
bosscape:The situation is becoming intolerable.
helper:You mean the lack of seating in these ships?
bosscape:No! The human and the rest of them.
helper:Yes, we should never have halted the extermination of these pathetic species.
bosscape:Quite. Falcon is the key. He must be expunged.
bosscape:The elders still prefer to force the council police to do our dirty work.
helper:With the backing of the rebels, the prophecy is becoming self fulfilling.
badcop:What if we make it look like an accident?
badcop:With these ships we could split into him whilst cloaked. Boom!
helper:Yes. It would make it look like an unfortunate collision with a comet. 
bosscape:We must not risk giving away our fleet's location yet.
bosscape:The so called taoists are planning something.
bosscape:Let us arrange another little explosion for Falcon.
helper:Our probes are seeking him out now, won't be long until they find him.
