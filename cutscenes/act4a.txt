Rich:Ok, guys.. all clear.
ktafly:Thanks, Rich. 
ktafly:Falcon is big trouble. The council won't wait much longer. 
ktafly:We have to get him to safety.
cjisri:Right on. My plans are complete. 
cjisri:Walker base is now active and we are rallying our ships.
ktafly:Nice work.
cjisri:I'll contact falcon and do my best to keep him safe.
ktafly:Any news on the shield code?
cjisri:It still eludes us but we'll find it soon enough.
ktafly:I hope the council has been negligent with their network security.
cjisri:I bet they have. They are bureaucrats.
ktafly:I don't gamble.
cjisri:Gee... lighten up, Fly man... 
cjisri:...It's all gravy.
