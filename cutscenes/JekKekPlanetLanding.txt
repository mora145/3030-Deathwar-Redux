dialogue
{
Falconsmall:Scans show a small campsite on the planet.
Falconsmall:Nice work setting up the launch mechanism, Kent.
Kentsmall:Thanks, Chief. But I still don't like Pods.
Kentsmall:Parachute fails, and splat! Very dangerous.
Falconsmall:I know, but it has special jamming equipment.
Falconsmall:You can land the ship undetected after I get down there.
Kentsmall:So you're just investigating what that cop is up to?
Falconsmall:Right. I just find out what's going on down there.
Kentsmall:Spy mission! In and out, clean. Like the old days.
Kentsmall:Strap in, Re-entry is a wild ride. 
Kentsmall:Heatsheild fails, and sizzle! Very dangerous.
Kentsmall:Unless you're a robot with a great cooling system, like me.
Falconsmall:Shut up, Kent.
