dialogue
{
cjisri:What were the elders thinking of with such a dangerous scheme?
cjisri:Nanos are one thing, but forcing a supernova?! A thousand people are dead!
ktafly:I doubt the elders did this...
ktafly:...this smells like the work of F'Zuh.
ktafly:Do you have any information about the device?
cjisri:Unfortunately, yes. 
cjisri:A package was delivered by John Falcon a few minutes before the explosion.
ktafly:Is the prophecy coming to pass? I'm suspicious of this whole thing.
ktafly:It seems F'zuh will stop at nothing. 
ktafly:It was not falcon's fault. He did not know.
ktafly:I am reliably informed he is a pawn in all of this. 
ktafly:He cannot know, it will devastate him.
cjisri:I understand. But what shall we do now?
cjisri:Shall we contact falcon?
ktafly:Not yet. I'll talk to a few people and see what we can do.
ktafly:Get in contact with him when I give you the signal.
ktafly:For now I hope he can survive on his own.
cjisri:Yes, when he is ready and has some more combat experience...
cjisri:...we can contact him again.
