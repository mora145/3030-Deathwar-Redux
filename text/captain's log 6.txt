The morgan yu guy asked me to take a package to daphice. Some kind of religious artefact. Not sure about that. Possibly unlicensed drugs or real owls. Best not to ask in the delivery business. It's for k'ta and he seemed okay.

Now I've got to get my ass through the nebula trail he left, and to daphice within 10:00 minutes. Time enough.
