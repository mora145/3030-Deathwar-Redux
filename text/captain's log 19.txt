So the clues are all known now. After talking to cji s'ri, I might be able to decipher the location of walker base by looking at the clue locations. 

Also, j'mes learner can help if I can find him. He's in th kp-fq1 system somewhere. Doesn't sound like a great guy though. cji said I need at least 10 kills before he'll even talk to me. 

It's not hard to find some real deserving scum in the dangerous systems.
