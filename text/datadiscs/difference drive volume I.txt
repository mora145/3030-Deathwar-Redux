Difference drives, mostly known as splitting by the workforce, is a complicated fusion of artificially created zeon particles and naturally occurring zoon particles in space.

This is a layman's description of how splitting or difference drives function.

Firstly, it is important to note that only ships built with difference drives can split. There currently isn't a modular design one can bolt onto a ship to create a split bubble. All ships in use today are built around the difference drive as they provide not only the split capability but also the ship's substantial power usage.

Difference drives are powered by hydrogen fuel. This isn't strictly true though, as the hydrogen is merely a catalyst to the zoon and zeon particle infusion. Hydrogen fuel is a necessary part of the split process. Some traders have even circumvented the purchase of hydrogen at stations by purchasing fuel scoop upgrades to use near stars. This is a cheap but dangerous money saving device.

When a ships engages its split drive, a bubble of zeon particles is created that surround the ship. The zeon particles are slowly released at various energies to react with the surrounding zoon particles in carefully calculated steps. Once a certain threshold has been reached (the split threshold), the object and space within the bubble (usually encompassing a further 4-5 om around the object) are sent into split space.

Split space is an extremely fast state of travel. This is not to say it is travel at all, but rather a state of travel, much like being on board a station as it rotated. Splitting and difference engines are relative names for unrelative situations.

For further information, plese see your location station's data library or look out for further editions of the layman's difference drive reference.
