megaball has become very popular as of late increasingly due to better vehicles and further advertisement funding. As many of you know, I, myself sponsor one of the best megaball drivers today, M Newsam. His fifth year winning streak has accelerated my froog juice supplement right into the stratosphere and I am reaping the rewards.

For those who don't know, megaball is a game consisting of one or more vehicles driven around an arena. It was developed a few years ago but didn't really take off until last year when M Newsam won the deciding match by driving onto the stands and killing 4 people. Whatever your thought on that, audience members agree to a terms and conditions when they buy the ticket. 

The rules are simple: one or more cars drive around collecting various coloured balls. These balls are shot from randomly placed dispensers and are active in the playing arena. when they are collected (by driving over) these balls will trail behind a driver's vehicle slowing it. these different balls can be collected:

* Red. One point.
* green. two points.
* yellow. three points.
* blue. four points.
* white. five points. (this ball is very rare)

The driven then drives into a ball collection zone where his trail of balls is counted up and points awarded. There are also various other balls a driver can pick up: 

* 2x multiplication. any ball points in the string are multiplied by 2.
* 4x multiplication. these balls were removed from the game early on.
* 6x multiplication. these balls were removed from the game early on.

prizes for megaball contests can range depending on the bet placed by the driver. Bets can start form as little as $100 and go upto $5000. If you require any more information on megaball please see the bar droid at the above venues who will direct you to the megaball arena.
