So who mines these days?

Mining is an expensive business but with a big enough ship you can make some serious money. According to the miner's guild in a recent poll, the asteroid scanner was classed as the most basic of tools. We caught up recent expert miner Aron Glas who told us:

You'll probably need an asteroid scanner to initially survey the possible asteroids. Then you'll need any kind of tractor beam to get the mineral to your holding bay. I find the most boring aspect of mining to be the... mining. I don't like lasers, never have. my mother always told me, she said: "Aron, you'll become a miner one day. You'll hate it." she was right, I hate it. But I'm damned good at it. Better than you. Better than you could ever be.

So who mines these days? Loners, it seems. People who don't want to interact with other station dwellers. If you think you have what it takes and you're a loner then take it up.
