First off, Bounties and fines are pretty much the same thing, as they both mean the police and bounty hunters will be after you. But, Unless you're a pirate, this isn't really anything to get all too worried about, as there are ways to make them go away, some legal, some less so.

The easiest and normal solution is for you to contact the police and offer to pay off the bounty yourself, as in most cases the bounty will be equal to your outstanding fines. You can either talk to a police officer in person, or open a comms channel to any nearby station. Both will offer you the chance of paying off the fines you owe, thereby clearing your name.

There are other options as well, though we wouldn't suggest using them, and of course we never used any of them ourselves. Ahem.. That being said, our friend's brother steve told us that some officers on stations may be open to a bit of cash on the side. Although it is risky, the payoff is that you clear your fines for a lot less than their normal cost. If it goes wrong though, you'll be stuck with another fine on top, for attempted bribery.

Another option Steve told us about is to find a well respected pirate station. In these, there are usually some persons of dubious character hanging around the bar, which can help you clear your criminal records in exchange for cold hard cash. They might not be standing at the bar with the traders though, so you will have to look around for them.

As a final note, you can also learn to get by with a bounty on your head. Stations must still offer you standard docking services, under council regulation [C553], and you will even be able to enter the bar and use the consoles, as long as there's no officer guarding the entrance. If there is a cop present, you can always undock and try again later.
