Eldonitrate price are down, down, down!

Since production tax has fallen in our system and we've cut wages to the station workers, our prices for Eldonitrate have fallen like a drunk droid.

Wyikieyne Heti Station 2 is your stop for fake beards this time of year. We've a surplus so take advantage. Now, now, now.
