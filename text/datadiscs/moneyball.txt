Moneyball, not to be confused with the video game Megaball, is a popular sporting event held in pirate systems.

Unlike megaball, which is mostly a sport of friendly competition, racers in moneyball are in it for the win, even if it could mean their death. The game is known to be extremely dangerous as the chance of violence is always high, and not few matches have been decided with lasers and missiles instead of by the rules.

The goal of the game is to chase and catch the Moneyball, which slowly orbits the stadium in a circular fashion. Most of the time, the ball will be inactive. The ball can only be caught, and the prize thus won, when it is active.

The game can usually be found in the more dangerous systems. keep an eye out for large groups of pirate ships converging on a location. Be aware, racers will show up orange instead of the usual pirate red, as they are not hostile towards civilians during the races. If you value your wallet and a nice wad of cash more than your life, feel free to join in!
