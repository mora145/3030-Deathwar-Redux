Need hydrogen fuel? Doesn't everybody?! Yes is the answer you're looking for. 

Does it annoy you fuel prices are so high? A new shou de incentive has just recently been put in place to decrease hydrogen fuel prices in bd-946 only. So why not stop by, buy a few military style droids and maybe even rustle up the courage to fight mega-tron-2, the universe's friendliest black belt karate droid.

You won't be disappointed with our stations either, with three, count them, three tonki stations to choose from, you'll be here quite some time.

shou de warning: be vigilant of pirates, our system is crawling with bogeys.
