A recent survey from the miner's guild had this to say about popular mining spots around the systems:

p1257+12 is a popular site. The system is a little risky but if you're willing to encounter pirates to make a credit then this is the place for you.

waiool is a decent place if you don't get killed. 3 trade stations, 6 planets and a half decent government make is an ok place for hardened miners.

Try it, you might like it.
