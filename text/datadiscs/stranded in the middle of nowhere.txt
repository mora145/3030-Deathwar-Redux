So you've been stranded in the middle of nowhere. Did you remember to bring extra fuel? No? Oh christ, you're more or less dead. Unless you can scoop fuel from a star's corona you're in for a long flight back.

We recently ran into a pilot, Gri Olle who had a near encounter with death. "It's scary out there without fuel", he says. We know, we've been there too, Gri. "Luckily I had a class 2 fuel scoop so, moving close to a star I managed to scoop enough to split to the nearest station and grab me some more. Thank god."

We at datadiscs Aolol think god had nothing to do with it. Just be wary people.
