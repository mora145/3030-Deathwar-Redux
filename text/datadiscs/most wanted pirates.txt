Have you seen the wanted pirate recently? no? Why the hell not? There are some mean ass pirates out there and if you've got the guts and more importantly, the weapons and shields, then you can make some pretty good money.

The council recommends that anyone wanting to take on a pirate should check the most wanted list and head for the last known location. Upon destruction of the ship, the council will credit your account. Be careful though, these guys are bad. Real bad.

Why do these pirates do it? We talked to research scientist, Dana Scully. She had this to say: 'I think pirates have no choice. I'm not defending them, don't get me wrong. But with current food stuffs running out they have no choice but to plunder. We in the colonial regions or regions with enough money to warrant police protection have it good. Those not living under police protection are run by pirate gangs. These gangs have all the power. And why not, they use greed and physical intimidation to get what they want. And who's there to stop them? Nobody. So these gangs cultivate a "join us or suffer" policy. If I personally, was in that situation I'd join too but keep my head low. In the end, when you're killing a pirate you could be killing a real pirate or someone forced into the trade. Either way, you're killing someone. Keep that in mind when you're blasting them.'

Well, if you don't want to blast some scum after that little monologue then you're probably crazy.
