Ever wanted to turn whilst splitting? Yes? Then good news, with the new advances in difference calculation means you can now turn whilst splitting. Enabling a difference computer will allow you to turn, albeit slowly (depending on the computer speed).

Some scientists thought that turning whilst splitting was impossible because of the trillions of intricate calculations that are necessary when travelling at such speeds. But thanks to new technology from the visors we can now enjoy the convenience.

If you're one of those traders that likes to make the best of split time then maybe you should buy one of these. Go on, you know you want to. Just do it. DO IT!
