As any pilot will attest, flying through nebula is a bad idea. Many have developed quirky ways of avoiding them, like finding special tunnels or sticking to set trade routes. But not many people know much about the things. They know they're annoying and they know they disrupt split engines but why?

We spoke to lead scientist, Uri Ewr of the colonial science division who had this to say: "Nebula play a part in our space, a very important part. But many people don't know why their split engines don't work right in them. Split engines have a special system of de-interlacing neutrons. The problem is nebulas stop this de-interlacing causing your split drive to slow down significantly. The de-interlacing effects also cause damage to a ship's systems and hull, which is why we give everyone the same advice: If you ever find yourself inside a nebula, turn around immediately and get out of there."

Well, there you have it. You can now tell your space trading friends why their mega cruisers slow down in a nebula. You can even make out you knew all along.
