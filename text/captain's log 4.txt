I finally made enough money to buy a split capable ship, so went to see k'ta and he offered me a job. He seems OK. A bit up his own arse, but reasonable enough.

I returned his cargo to him and he told be some info about the taoists, cleaners and the council. he said he'd contact me. I'll just build my finances back up with some other jobs until he does.
