I picked up some scientist and dropped him off at walker base. I'm becoming quite a common sight around these parts. Had a talk with 433 in his office. The cleaner codes are finally unlocked and their shields down. Now it's a fair fucking fight. I'm gonna kick some cleaner ass.

When we undock they'll all be there, ready for us. It's the final fight. If I don't make it, and it's you reading this, Vasquez, or you, Kent, you can share my credit account between you. 

It's been fun knowing you. I'll arm up and do some damage for the humans, baby.
