Shit. what just happened! daphice just exploded. I'd just left on my way out and the sun just exploded. I saw a massive ball of red behind me and the cabin shook violently. My shields are damaged and the hull took a beating too but I'm fine. 

how could this have happened? All those people. Oh shit. I guess this is what the last sailors out of Pompei harbour felt like. Real lucky.

Maybe K'ta will get back in contact with me. I'll just keep on doing what I do best, quickly moving away from fatal levels of radiation.
