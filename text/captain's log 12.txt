well, cji s'ri told about this bullshit prophecy. I didn't tell him Falcon is not my real name, it just had a nice ring to it. He seems to believe there might be something to it. either way it's an adventure, right?

someone called raal at frija, wherever that is, has some information about these clues to the whereabouts of walker base, which seems important.

cji s'ri also told me about a wormhole near the second moon of the first planet of Aenso (123,66) that would shorten my trip, but they can be hard to find.

I can visit raal in beexen.
