So, i finally meet the taoist boss and what does he do? he has me searching asteroid fields for a piece of floating debris. Apparently, when I have a mining scanner, I'm supposed to go to waessda and aresswa, check their asteroid fields and click on any marked debris I find. They'll report whether I've found the package or not. Then I should tractor it back to walker base.

Maybe I'll check the data discs he gave me too. I just want to get some payback for daphice but as I have no leads to do it my way. This will have to do.
