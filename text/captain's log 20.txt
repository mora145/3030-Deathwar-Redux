J'mes learner told me the password, which, in my humble opinion, is a tad cliche. But never mind, now I can find walker base and get on board. Then I can finally talk to 433-2c or whoever, and get this all sorted. He seems like the boss-boss.

If I put the clues together, Walker base must be around coordinates 10,1. My hud will show a green marker when I get close. Better get my ass over there before more suns get exploded.
