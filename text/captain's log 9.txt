I took care of the stab drones for grah, and also shot some crazy assassin lady on a hoverboard. Grah says she was the behind all the murders recently and i did everyone a service by taking her out. 

Grah has kept his word, and let kent go. I'm taking my little buddy back on as navigator, even though he always has the craziest ideas of what to do next. If things go his way, we'll be searching the nearby nebulas for these weird aliens he keeps babbling on about. I'm not that into space aliens myself, but who knows, maybe we'll go check it out.
