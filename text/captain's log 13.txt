interesting. my ship's been changed and I've been given some money. After I was set up to blow up daphice and killed everyone there, I might be in a little bit of danger. I can't believe I was responsible for all that. Me? If I'd only known I would have flown outside the safe systems with my 'religious artefact' and destroyed it. A thousand people are dead because of me. 

On a lighter note, I have the four clues now; all contacts newly added to my contact list.

* evan t'ny in tibefa
* glor ops in enuray
* geri h'ge in waiool
* rh 445 in the badlands

It doesn't matter which order I visit them in, but I should probably go see them. I bet they'll all want something done for them. Hopefully this new ship has a washing machine, I've not managed to get a new set of clothes since my detra got impounded.
