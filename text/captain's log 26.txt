All I can say is, wow. I've never been down to a green planet before. So much sky, so vast. Like the old movies of earth. Apparently all planets have been clear of nanos for 300 years. With the misinformation being fed to us no one dared risk a visit.

Once word gets around people will quickly rush to get their feet on the ground. Free land, fresh air, and a chance to build something new. For myself, I've finally got money and a good ship. I'll keep flying until I see a good opportunity.

So I allowed myself to get led through an adventure, and why not? It passed the time, but I don't think I learnt anything. Life has its ups and downs, and the consequences of any one event keep on changing.

This episode in my life is over, and I can finally get myself some new clothes and a real owl.

Predictions were wrong. 3030 looks like it will be a good year.
