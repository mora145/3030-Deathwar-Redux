I met a guy named Evan t'ny and did some jobs for him, one of which was landing on a freaking planet!

The guy I was supposed to gather information on was on a nearby station at first. He had vital information to the t'ny guy though, so I had to follow him down to a planet's surface where I spied on him and some of his goons. Pretty crazy, but it all turned out swell in the end, as I've got the next clue now.

Hm.. but Resseth? What the hell does that mean? What kind of clue is that? I know where resseth is but how does that help? Still, I've got other clues. I'll work it out.
