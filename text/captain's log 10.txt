Seems like everything I do brings me back to the daphice explosion. I can't stop thinking about it. I don't know how it happened, I'm just glad I wasn't in the blast too much.

K'ta Fly hasn't contacted me yet. I feel he'll be in contact soon, and this involves his group somehow. I'll just keep staying alive. Strange days indeed.
