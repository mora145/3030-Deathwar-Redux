I'm a wanted man. In all the systems! I knew I would be one day. I'm a mighty Pirate. There's a bounty of $250 million on my head. I've never seen or even heard of that kind of money before. Someone wants me dead, and quick. I even made the news. From now on I'll only be safe at pirate stations. There aren't many so it makes refuelling a little bit difficult. 

Never mind, eh. Could always be worse. I could be in jail, but at least then I would get some new clothes.

At least Cji S'ri left me a contact in my list. If I go there I should be safe. I can talk to him about all this. It's getting out of hand. All I did was help a guy with a cargo run!

Maybe he can help me with all these stupid clues. I have an idea, but I'm not sure yet.
