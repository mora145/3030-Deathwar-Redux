Trader dances naked, gets burned
Jia Kun
A trader dressed in his spacesuit. In a space-bar. No surprise there you may think. This trader however was only wearing the top half of his suit. He nakedly danced on the bar for several hours and generally was cause of great mirth and entertainment to drinkers who showered the trader with drinks. The scene turned sour when the dancing drunk stepped on the hand of a Jia Kun bounty hunter who felt it would be even more amusing if he lit the high-percentage alcho mix that the dancer was drenched in. The unnamed drunk required synth-legs and a synth genital unit. 

Bar droids have now been informed to warn people dancing on all bar surfaces to take care to avoid other bar users.
