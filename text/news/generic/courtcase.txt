Is this the best court case yet?

Pirate boss ROBERTO GIANNETTO is not only up on charges of heading an organised crime syndicate, twenty five counts of piracy, fourteen counts of murder, two kidnappings and his role in encouraging the rioting and take over of a council run station. Oh no, he is also accused of lewd behavior with various non-indigenous lifeforms from his large personal zoo. Everyone loves a good court case, but this takes the melon. The jury in conjunction with the logical reasoning droid committee is set for a disturbing session when they have to view video footage filmed by the alleged pirate leader's bodyguards.

The incident occurred after over a thousand close associates of the defendant, all thinking themselves above the space-wide law banning planet visitation, went down to an abandoned moon base. Apparently they were invited to celebrate Giannetto's birthday, with the animals being used in various ways, such as being hunted with grenades and forced to race whilst being ridden by modified cleaning droids.

Where the lewd conduct comes into play is anyone's guess until the court case is released for public viewing, no doubt involving a reconstruction with laughable production values. Still, I'd buy that for a dollar-cred.
