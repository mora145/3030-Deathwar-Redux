Senior Council member smashes tank.
Taoist
A senior Council member JESS FABRIZI whilst holding a meeting with alienated traders complaining about trade restrictions, became, what one witness called, insanely aggressive. The meeting held in a station bar was said to be going well, that is until the logical reasoning of the councillor was brought into question by a vocal Hydrogen trader. FABRIZI was heckled by the trader with such taunts as; 'You are using cyclical reasoning, like an idiot.' and 'I laugh at your shifting justifications, you are clearly either trying to delude people or are delusional.' At which councillor FABRIZI lost her composure shouting; 'Look at him, he's a just dirty, pathetic hydrogen trader.' 

What happened next cannot be confirmed for certain, but the general consensus is that several members of the audience were also Hydrogen traders and a small riot ensued involving traders and security staff. At some point it is alleged that councillor FABRIZI shouted, 'Come on lads', (referring to her security team), 'let's trash this scum-hole.' Proceeding to smash the bar's tropical fish tank with a bar-stool. Of course, the camera footage has been lost.
