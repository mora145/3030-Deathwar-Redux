We all known the tale, an unknown force forced the formation of the Council so many decades ago, and lead to the great migration of all sentient life to this small pocket of space and remaining baryonic matter. Although there have been various theories, most believe there is some sentient enemy destroying ships and matter in conventional ways using conventional ships which may be destroyed. This enemy came to be commonly called 'cleaners' after the decimation of the planets by what is believed to be some form of self-replicating nano-tech, and linking the two problems.

Several Shou De and Jia Kun leaders in an rare agreement between the factions are calling for the Council to restart the probing of the rim with the latest scanning equipment. The Council are still reluctant to release new probes claiming that liveable space has not reduced since the probes where stopped and the risks out way the benefit of new information being gleaned.
