Police demand higher wages.
Shou De
The united Council police force are requesting an urgent review of the rate of pay after the quality of recruits reached and all time low. Even senior members anonymously will say so, most people applying these days have a criminal past or clearly have a tendency towards injudicious aggression, corruption, ignorance and will to power. 

One regional police head we shall call 'PoliceDroid 75' said to this paper, 'Only by offering fair pay for a dangerous and socially demanding role will standards improve. Most of my staff now should be in jail themselves.' When pushed about what criminal activities the police get up to, he would only say, 'Get up to, ha, it would be hard to name a crime that wasn't committed and justice evaded by one or more colleges I've met or heard of.' 

When asked how many police he believed genuinely had the public good as their dominant motivation, 'PoliceDroid 75' involuntarily snorted the milk he was drinking through his nose.
