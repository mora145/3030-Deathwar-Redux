Monkey Habitable Planet?
Shou De
Professor Boronball Gholt has developed and tested a device to generate a breathable atmosphere on an inhospitable moon.  The device, roughly the size of a small escape pod uses inverse chaos theory, which on detonation creates an energy field of 100 Tera Watts, and has to be guided manually. A monkey was trained to do the job, however on the test, decided that escape was a better option than to be de-materialised.

A task force needs be set up to hunt the small but very destructive ship, however, the council haven't the budget or resources.  A Council spokesperson said 'We did not agree to the testing of this device, so we have put a notice out to all traders. If you should see a monkey stealing bananas who answers to Bubbles, please contact us. It is important you do not try and apprehend him as he is in control of a very powerful device.'
