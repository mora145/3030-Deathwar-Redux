Information required for lost ship
Jia Kun
Have you seen a ship five miles long recently? No? It'd be hard to miss but apparently a company calling themselves jupiter mining corp have lost one. She's classed as a long range mining vehicle and is suspected of being lost after problems arose with her engines.

If anyone has any information about her whereabouts please contact rob or doug at the bbc.
