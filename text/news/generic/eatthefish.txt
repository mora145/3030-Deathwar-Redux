Don't eat the fish!

Many people have been getting food poisoning on board stations run by the Council. Nothing new there you may think, but this time there is suspicion of contamination of the bio-tanks used to breed all marine foodstuffs from fresh shrimp to horned monkfish. Council head of bio-synth food production was unavailable for comment. One hospitalised trader who became vomitous after purchasing and consuming whelks said this in an exclusive interview: 

'I will personally hunt down the head of bio-synth food production and make him eat my whelk.'
