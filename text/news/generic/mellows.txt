A "cooking" good arrest
Jia Kun
Police yesterday arrested a colonist for attempting to roast marshmallows at the base of his ship's class 6 thrusters. After getting treatment for burned eyebrows and a singed third nipple, Juy Hgan suggested that 'We should all take it easy. He was just enjoying some marshmallows. Why don't we all do that once in a while?' We do here at Shou De Head quarters.
