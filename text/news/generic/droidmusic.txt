Droid music makes me sick
Jia Kun
Even most droids will agree that the music they 'create' is rubbish. Some artificial synthoids think they can compete with the organics' proven superiority in the areas of classical-funk and beyond. The latest of these droid musicians, CORMAC KIEVER, likes to call himself 'Smacktonic-tronic' has developed a sizable fan-base. His breakthrough albums, 'Don't call me synth.' and 'Here comes Smacktonic-tronic' are just re-workings, and poor ones, of hits by the organic band 'The Warbirds'. The question you have to ask is, who's buying it? 

Judging from the sales figures there has to be some organics buying this junk. Smacktonic-tronic, more like moronic-tronic.
