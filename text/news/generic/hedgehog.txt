Police were baffled today as they talked down a potential suicide jumper who had overdosed on the lethal drug oipeen. When the man in question, originally from the SJ's belt region was questioned in custody he collapsed after attempting a breakout of his cell screaming 'sonic ate my hamster'. The Police have refused to comment.
