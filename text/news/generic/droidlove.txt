Droid loves droids, much too much
Jia Kun
A droid was released today after being charged with kidnapping droids. Her rather unusual defence, considering the years it took for droids to gain equal rights with organics, was that it wasn't really a crime as droids aren't really alive anyway. She said, 'I'm just a droid doing what I feel I ought to. I love those crazy droids, when I see one, be it a cleaner or a little bio-contaminant detector, I just gotta take it home with me'. When her shuttle was raided after a tip off from a bar droid working for the Tech-Noir franchise, she was found to have crammed over seventy miscellaneous maintenance droids in her hold, held with epoxy-steel chains.

One of the rescued, DARREN RIEU, said, 'It's a disgrace, re-setting to factory settings is not a punishment at all. I've been held in a stink hole for two years with nothing but the incessant banter of cleaning droids talking about the best way to wax vertical surfaces.
