Is your Droid reprogrammed.. to Kill?
Colonial
VAN ALOUF, a trader based in the Shou De systems is the first person to be convicted of the new crime of 'droid reprogramming with intent to kill'. He was caught on camera in a station bar slipping a memory device into a bar droid serving drinks. Shortly after the droid in question spontaneously burst into flames and chased a shocked MANUAL BAGWILL from the station reportedly trying to grab his leg and melt all over him. Had the droid caught him, he would have received at least near-fatal burns and probably fatal burns. Several witnesses agreed,'He would have definitely received fatal burns, defo.' After it was discovered that Alouf knew and hated Bagwell after a bar fight about sports, one detective requested the camera footage and made the connection. 

Van Alouf claims his innocence shouting to reporters as he left court, 'I've been set up, that wasn't me, it was well a synth droid made to look like me. He doesn't even have my walk.'
