Shuttle pilot rams station.
Shou De
One disgruntled space trader who lost his ship to pirates, then lost his insurance claim, (despite paying his company the highest rate for eight years), then lost his temper. Despite all this misfortune he was set to work his way out of his poverty by doing some inter-system junk removal from space lanes. Yesterday however, after his shuttle suffered a micro-meteorite impact and was losing cabin pressure, he was denied his request for an emergency dock and told to remain queuing. For MILTON TOMKIEWICZ this was the final punch in the abdomen. He rammed the control tower, though due to the auto speed limiter, only caused minor scraping. He was then arrested and taken to a maximum security stockade. He promptly escaped and is 'at large'. 

Most people say good luck to him.
