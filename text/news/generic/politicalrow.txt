Shou De political row
Shou De
Today two of the Shou De's most powerful political figures were caught arguing in a secret cabinet meeting. Mitushi Futiwama and Misao Himura have always been known as "opposite sides of the same coin" for their strong, but opposite beliefs for what is the best way forwards for the Shou De people. More to come soon. Long time Secretary of the two refused to comment but we here at the Shou De gazette think there's something good on the horizon.
