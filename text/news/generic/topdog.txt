Jai Kun pilots still top dog
Jia Kun
It is official, Jia Kun traders and bounty hunters have the highest kill per death ratio of all factions. A study, commissioned by this paper, asked over one hundred pilots from each faction and non-aligned pilots. We took this information to a bar in Jia Kun space to inform the hard spacers of the good news. Bounty hunter RORY TAGALOE said, 'Oh yeah, you know it, we're kicking pirates out of our space. Our biggest problem is not having enough evil people to kill, cause we keep killing em.'

Another pilot with ten kills this month alone said, 'If the Council brought down the price of weapons for the law abiding traders, the piracy would be gone in a week.' Now there's an idea.
