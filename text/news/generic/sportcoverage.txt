Traders demand sports coverage.

Tv coverage of sports features has dropped of to an all time low. Even zero-G darts has been banned from the news 'for encouraging dangerous projectile impulsion' which when played in some second hand ship's cargo bays have been know to cause a hull breach. Most other sports coverage was banned from trader bars after it was found to promote instantaneous combat over irrational rivalries between a minority of supporters. These findings were from just one survey conducted in 3027 which asked questions such as, 'Have you ever wanted to have instantaneous combat when listening to idiots talking about sports?' and leading questions like 'How would you choose to attack a trader who said your favourite orbital space racing team could be outrun by local shuttle craft.'

Combining that with the fact that they only questioned one hundred people, one wonders, after such a weak study, what idiots commissioned it and how it may lead to the majority of sports coverage being banned from all bases.
