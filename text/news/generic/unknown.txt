Unknown boaster killed in bar brawl!
Taoist
Yesterday evening an unknown white male was stabbed in the head and heart an astounding 57 times by an angry mob after boasting his support and connections to the unknown. It was later discovered that the drifter, originally a toaist merchant had never flown anywhere farther than the system for fear of the unknown.
