Colonial
A "firefly"  bomb exploded in a busy station killing five-hundred instantly and injuring hundreds more. The firefly bomb contained hundreds of smaller verion-charges that, when exploded, are dispersed into the air imitating a large movement of fireflies. 

The station rescue workers and a major police action force was immediately put into operation to help free people still trapped. Chief of police, Miles Fhii, had this to say: 'This is a heinous crime. We do not and will not stand for this kind of behaviour. This is the first time I've ever seen a bomb blast. I hope to never see one again.'
