Should organic pilots be banned.
Taoist
Every other decade the very same debate comes around. Should organic pilots with all their lapses in mental control, be allowed to pilot craft capable of splitting through habitation units. Council member 753-A has raised the issue yet again at the department of piracy and space safety. 

There are growing calls from station dwellers to, if not ban organic pilots, then at least restrict them to systems with low population stations. 'They are the scum of the space lanes, why not leave it to the artificial-life forms like us, we don't freak out so much.' said one droid trader referring to organic pilots. 

The Shou De designed central shipping-control hub has been proven to be operational and effective in tests; yet most organics and droids do not like the idea of centrally controlled shipping. most concerns centre on its vulnerability to pirate hackers and central government corruption and control. 

The debate goes on, and on.
