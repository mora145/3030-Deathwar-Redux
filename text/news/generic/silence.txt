1 Day silence
Colonial
The Shou De have today began a ritual 24 hour silence in remembrance to the battle fleet lost exactly three hundred years ago in the 'revenge assault' which devastated the small planet of Fir. The entire fleet was wiped out within a matter of minutes reducing the Shou De military power to a bare minimum. There will be a vigil read by the famous Wilt Gode and a song sung by the infamous Dark Legs.
