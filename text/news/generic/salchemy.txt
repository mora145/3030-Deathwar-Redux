Alchemy hero celebration
Colonial
It's been exactly 1 year today since famous alchemist Edwar Elric synthesised ore and silver creating the widely used hemingstone. Hemingstone is now the base for most afterburners as it has the highest known melting point of about 5000oF; 500oF hotter than ruthenium. A ceremony will be held on Thursday to commemorate him with a statue made from pure copper.
