Hull temperature rising
Colonial
Ever felt your hull temperature fluctuating in unaccountable ways. Thats what AMOS WIDHALM found when on a parcel delivery job. He checked his scanners and sub-sub systems but couldn't find the problem. Eventually he checked his own body temperature in case he had caught Frankinline flu mutation, but no. The heating variations were emanating from his parcel, a metal crate with vents which was producing jets of super heated plasma into the cargo hold. He was forced to eject the crate and tow it with a tractor lest it damage his hull, or worse, suddenly emit a lethal amount of plasma and fry him alive. The crate turned out to be a malfunctioning plasma-vent conduit, ordered for a station's power plant to replace an aging model. It was activated before being packed to test the device but someone forgot to switch it off. 

WIDHALM was quite angry until they paid him triple and offered him triple to return it as well.
