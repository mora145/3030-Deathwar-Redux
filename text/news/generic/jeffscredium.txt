Taoist "hippie", use for Jeffscredium
Shou De
A taoist medicine man was slammed yesterday for suggesting the use of jeffscredium for back pain. The rare mineral jeffscredium used in ship production is commonly known as a high contact poison, being used in several high profile associations by the shou De. When questioned, the man, 46, said 'I think it's just stupid. Come on. come on!'. 

Regardless, his drug peddling days are over; he'll begin serving a 405 year sentence this coming monday. Please address any abuse to us, here at the Shou De Gazette.
