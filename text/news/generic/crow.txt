"Angry Crow", last flight 
Colonial
The colony hero captain sanoske hitchimora died peacefully in space last night after more than 20 years' faithful service as a police officer. He earned the nickname angry crow from the huge number of pirates he captured in his specially modified police viper, 'the crow'. Police chief Miles Fhii had this to say of the man: 'He once arrested me you know.'
