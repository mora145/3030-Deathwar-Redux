The Council vs traders
Jia Kun
Just what have the Council got against traders? We all know we need traders to ship vital supplies around as well as consumer goods. So why do they insist on these harsh quarantine regulations and intrusive screening before granting permission just to apply for a station pass. No major bio or nano weapons have been found on traders for years. The last outbreak of viregian blisteroids was proven to be caused by a maniac droid, already living on station who made the bacteria for a cooking experiment. 

Can't we have some sensible Councillors and let traders mix with the rest of us again?
