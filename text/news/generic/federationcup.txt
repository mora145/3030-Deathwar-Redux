Brownstone scandal
Shou De
The Brownstone federation Cup of orbital-racing has dramatically sacked four of its top board members after an advertising scandal. The four were found taking payments from the winner of the prestigious advertising rights contract. The most notable sacking was the late Jacksonville Reeger who after his sacking flew his pleasure-cruiser into the nearest moon.

The rest of the board members released a statement saying; 'We have purged all corruption from the sport and in the future outside audits will be used to ensure no further scandals of this type.' adding 'We all regret the death of Jacko, he was a true character.'
