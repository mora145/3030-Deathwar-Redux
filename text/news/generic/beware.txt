Galaxy Rangers Beware!
Jia Kun
A vigilante group of colonists dubbing themselves the "galaxy rangers" are raiding across the systems striking traders and pirates alike. The group claim to be dispersing justice through "the verse" but in reality they are a massively organised crime federation. 

Warnings have been issued system wide to not let fighter class ships bearing the "righteous indignation" logo board your ship at all costs.
