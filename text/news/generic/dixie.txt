Arrested for speeding? blame passengers
Colonial
A trader, ELISHA DIXEY, was arrested today for speeding into a busy docking bay. She claimed that her passengers had threatened her with hypno-rays if she did not force her way into the queue and dock asap. When she was confronted by police officer Quanf Johansen, her passengers had already disembarked and left the arrivals area, either having passes into the station proper, or boarding another vessel. Obviously without these passengers, DIXEY will be held responsible for the actions of her vessel and be required to pay the fine. Sticking to her story, she refused to pay and so was arrested for civil disobedience. 

Police are on the look out for the accused passengers who did appear on DIXEY'S ships manifest. One was always space-suited, the other was a human male. They were using the IDs, JAMES NICKS and BRADY APRILL. If you have had an interaction with either police ask for information. Do not attempt to restrain them yourself, they may have hypno-rays and blasters.
