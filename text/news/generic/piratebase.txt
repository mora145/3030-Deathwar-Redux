Pirate base discovered
Taoist
Police have found a pirate base in an outer rim asteroid field. The base was constructed from several derelict craft with the core being a functional large trading craft. Although an ingenious creation, the base must have acted as a hive of crime for hundreds of AU around. Since it's discovery pirate activity has halved. the discovery was made by officer WENDY MUNCEY who claimed it was a stroke of luck, and that she was only doing a random sweep for a illegal mining.

A film recorded from inside the base shows great tv screens and entertainment 'zones' with huge quantities of neon lighting and dry-ice units. Many people have raised the indisputable point, that the pirates must have been informed of the raid, as it was completely empty despite being obviously used to accommodate several thousand people, well shady. There is to be an investigation into the case.
