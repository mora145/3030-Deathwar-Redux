Five marooned miners found alive.
Colonial
Five crystal miners who were mistakenly wiped from their company's manifest as it shut down operations on a large asteroid, were left behind on the outpost. It was three weeks before the mistake was recognised by an auditing droid. After sending back several ships to search for them, the task was given up as they didn't have sufficient oxygen supplies to last out. Yet despite the odds, the miners had helped themselves, constructing a vessel from scrap. After two months their makeshift solar-sail craft cruised into the nearest spacedock.
 
One of the miners, IVAN KIETZMAN, said, 'Of course, we're all glad to be alive, but we're also very angry and out for payback. The company management should face the consequences and we wont stop until we get satisfaction.' They are now filing a law suit against the company and going on a drinking holiday, after some g-exercise that is.
