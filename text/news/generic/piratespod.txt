Pirates tractor beam the 'wrong' escape-pod
Jia Kun
Some pirates on the border of Jia Kun space received a shock last week when they pulled an escape-pod into their cargo bay, just ejected from a large freighter they disabled with blaster fire.
The pod, on opening, was full to the hilt with seventeen heavily armed police officers. The freighter which was giving off distress signals before attracting the pirates, was part of a sting operation to capture a particularly nasty and elusive pirate gang, whose ships repeatedly evaded capture by conventional means. 

The freighter used was no loss to the public purse as it was strapped together space junk. The police chief leading the operation said,'It all went down like I planned it. I love it when a plan comes together.'
