Shou De don't know how to party
Jia Kun
The festival period in Shou De stations was apparently 'disrupted' by hard drinking revellers who took out their ships for an impromptu orbital race. The local police claimed that pilots shouldn't race drunk or intoxicated even in festival season. One trader on a visit said, 'It's insanity gone mad, if we wanna race, then baby, we race!' 

I don't know about you, but this reporter thinks it's this kind of attitude that we need to overcome the 'cleaners' and the Council's unwillingness to go for the tough solution.
