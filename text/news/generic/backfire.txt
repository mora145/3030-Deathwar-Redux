Thruster upgrade backfires
Shou De
A trader who decided to modify his ship with thrusters has had a close shave recently. 

He fixed quad engines far in excess of the ship's hull specifications. The max thrust generated by his modifications, including post-nitro coils and pre-nitro coils, was one thousand times the recommended load for the engine pylons. On ignition he learned his first lesson in engineering as the top half of his vessel sheared off and accelerated beyond the processing capacity of his navigation computer, which aimed him directly at the system's sun. Luckily for him he hadn't modified his escape pod which saved him, but has suffered massive internal injuries and bleeding. 

Still, for a brief period he was the fastest man in the system and he still has the bottom half of his freighter, shnarf!
