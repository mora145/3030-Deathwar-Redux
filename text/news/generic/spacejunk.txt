Space Junk, don't split through it.
Jia Kun
An increasing amount of space junk, an increasing number of poorly trained (if trained at all) space pilots can only mean one thing. Yes, more people than ever this year have diff-split into junk, a new survey says. A spokesperson for independent traders and pilots said 'Yo yo yo, listen to me, I'm gonna tell you all the way it is. Most of the junk is being tipped by major companies and the military-industrial shipping. They should bring back the junk sweeper ships, yo.' She refused to comment upon the perceived fall in standards of piloting skills. 

One trader interviewed said,'Its getting a more common problem, these days people tip junk straight out the rear of their ship in the lanes, I think it's because they raised the removal costs so people just chuck it. But now its getting beyond belief around some inner station zones.'
