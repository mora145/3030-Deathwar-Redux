Space Traders Quarantined too far?
Colonial
The common-law quarantine protocol -- laid down by the Council -- restricting space traders to the docking and bar/hospitality areas have come into question. Many traders are unhappy with the time limited quarantine period, currently 2 weeks, before they can visit the rest of the population, services and recreational activities on stations proper. Some vocal traders argue they provide an invaluable service to the common good in their commodity trading. The risks are far too great however, claims Council secretary for life promotion Katana Fink, of nano-tech infiltration and pathogen transfer as well as the Frankinline flu mutation. 'Who wants that, only a shadbeast with a nasal tumor,'she added,' traders know their movement will be restricted and that is the price they pay for the high profits they can make.'
