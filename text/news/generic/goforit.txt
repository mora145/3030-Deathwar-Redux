Bounty hunting on the rise
Shou De
With so many outstanding warrants and bounties, many traders are turning their hand to space combat for fast cash. This helps explain the increase in sales of weaponry from shipyards across the systems. Some people claim the Council is taking advantage of poor traders to do the work of official law enforcement agencies. When this point was raised at a conference on piracy and space safety, it was surprisingly accepted. And all, traders asked seem to feel that it should be their choice to engage in space combat for profit.

If you are interested in bounty hunting, an official police promotional leaflet can be acquired free of charge from officers. To save you time, it says, 'Go for it!'.
