It has recently come to light that this criminal is responsible for the supernova at daphice. He is directly responsible for over 750 deaths and is wanted in connection with a spate of bombings related to the taoist party.

Please do not approach him unless you are a trained bounty hunter. 

He is no longer welcome at any council run station so you might find him at these known pirate stations where he will be able to use their facilities:

* GHA Station 1 in the KP-FQ1 system
* Qucieda in the KP-FQ1 system
* Eisti Station 1 in the BD-946 system
