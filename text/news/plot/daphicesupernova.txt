Daphice supernova!!!
Shou De
Urgent bulletin. Daphice, a system known for its rich deposits of jeffscredium has recently exploded. the M class sun exploded today destroying Ssinil and daphice II along with their moons and the only orbitting station, Ssinil Station 1. 

The system, previously known for its great megaball competitions was steeped in migration history. The planets were known for their glacial valleys and simple lifestyles before the nanos. 

Reports indicate that the supernova has killed over 750 people, all traders aboard Ssinil Station 1. One ship, the eastern, was on the outskirts when the supernova happened. The captain states seeing a ship leaving the system moments before the explosion but no other information is available.

We will keep you apprised of the situation. But for now, daphice is a molten rock. It is strongly advised you do not enter daphice space as radiation levels are extremely high.
