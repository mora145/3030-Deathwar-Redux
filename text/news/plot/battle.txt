Space Battle
Jia Kun

A while ago we heard of an epic space battle near the void. When questioned, the council firmly denied anything had happened but we are hearing from traders and pirates alike that something big went down in the middle of nowhere.

Exactly what happened is still sketchy but we are aware of at least one thing: If pirates and traders come forward with the same story then something is going on.

On another note, we have received a comms signal from someone calling themselves k'ta fly. He says it'll soon be okay to settle on planets. I don't know what he's on, readers but I want some of it myself.

I don't even remember what a sunrise looks like. I heard stories, saw vids, even experiences a vr sim, but this planet settling sounds extremely unlikely. But here's hoping.
