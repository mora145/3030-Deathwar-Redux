M5 Trader - Some say that all Montfords are cursed with the demons of past captains. Some say that's a pile of crap. You can't possibly believe that crud. Anyway, demons aside, this ship offers an impressive cargo size at the cost of a slow diff ratio. If you buy her just make sure you've had her exorcised first.
