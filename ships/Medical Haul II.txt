M5 Allrounder - A refitted hospital ship. Looking at her stats you're probably wondering why everyone doesn't use this as a cargo vessel. Look closely at her engine and turn stats. That's why. And with a turret and 10 missile racks if you come into a fight chances are good you'll be coming out of it.

funTrivia=The only known medical to still exist. There is no interesting trivia about this vessel. It's well boring.
